# Movie-Investment-Dashboard
This dashboard has been created as part of the coursework of  Data Visualisation module.
The user is a movie investor and he want to understand if the proposed movie project to invest in is de-risked. The investor knows that the power of the talent sells, and he wants to choose among the best talent available, and also he wants to know the potential revenue. He has two questions:
1.	Can revenue be predicted? (using budget available, IMBD score , runtime?)
2.	What movie production companies should be invested in?
